# Tapapat App

An interactive sound and animation kit inspired by [Patatap](https://patatap.com/).

[Try it out!](http://gvenezia.com/pClone.html)

For the animations, I use paper.js with Vanilla JS.

For the sound, I used howler.js and the [Neural Synchrony](https://github.com/jonobr1/Neuronal-Synchrony) sound samples

*(Note: Tapapat uses responsive design to fit the width of the viewscreen, but it currently requires a keyboard and so is not compatible with mobile)*
